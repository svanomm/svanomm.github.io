# Research Projects & Portfolio

Here are some of my key research projects and applications, demonstrating expertise in applied economics, machine learning, and data science.

## Featured Research

### [Sentiment Volume Forecasting](https://github.com/svanomm/sentiment-volume-forecasting)
**Machine Learning for Financial Markets**

Research project investigating the usefulness of news sentiment in predicting intraday stock trading volume for U.S. airline stocks. This comprehensive study demonstrates:

- **Scale**: Analysis of 1.3 million news articles from GDELT database
- **Real-time Processing**: 15-minute increment predictions during trading hours
- **Advanced ML**: TensorFlow, PyTorch, and ensemble methods
- **Performance**: Results comparable with state-of-the-art literature
- **Period**: January 2018 to May 2025 data coverage

**Technologies**: Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch, pandas, GDELT API, real-time data processing

**Key Finding**: While sentiment features provide marginal improvement in forecasting accuracy, the framework demonstrates the potential for real-time business monitoring applications.
