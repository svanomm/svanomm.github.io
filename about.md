# About Steven VanOmmeren

I am an applied economist and data scientist with a passion for using quantitative methods to solve complex real-world problems. My research and professional work focuses on the intersection of economics, statistics, and data science.

## Education
I graduated from the University of Chicago in 2020 with a BA in Economics and a BS in Mathematics.

I am currently pursuing an MS in Applied Economics at Boston College, expecting to graduate by the end of 2025.

## Professional Experience
Since graduating college in 2020, I have spent 5 years working in economic consulting, with most of my projects involving antitrust litigation, regression analysis, and damages estimation. I worked at Charles River Associates from 2020-2021, and have worked at BRG since 2021, both in the Washington, DC area.

## Research Interests

### Microeconometric Methods
My economic research employs modern econometric techniques including:
- Difference-in-differences estimation
- Causal inference methods
- Policy evaluation and impact assessment

### Predictive Analytics
I develop and apply machine learning models for economic and financial forecasting, with particular expertise in:
- Time series analysis and forecasting
- Explainable AI methods
- Big data processing and analysis (~billion-row data)

### Odds and Ends
Some of my spare time is spent on personal projects, with a particular interest in natural language processing and large language models:
- Building a local search engine complete with a PDF processing pipeline and semantic search
- Experimenting with local speech-to-text and text-to-speech models for computer accessibility
- Miscellaneous productivity-enhancing apps and workflows to help me work faster
